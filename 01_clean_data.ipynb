However, intuitively, those explanation was very hard for a fair number of scientists to swallow because it is hard to imagine how He and Ne, rare gases, would remain so isolate in an ever differentiating and evolving earth when all other isotopic systems and elements have been disturbed. Don Anderson (CIT) has now challenged this concept 2 in the latest issue of Science and argued that the high 3 He in the mantle source of the hot spot basalts may be seeing a subducted sedimentary component that contains extraterrestrial rare gases incorporated in tiny dust particles. In order to test this iconoclastic idea, the PI has formulated a simple but elegant test, namely to analyze old 0 80 million years) sedimentary cares from the oceans for these isotopes. His objective is to evaluate whether the results are negative or positive, will have great impact on our understanding of geochemical reservoirs in the earth's mantle, cosmic fluxes of materials to the oceanic sediments, and the importance of subducted sedimentary component in oceanic island volcanism.\n",

Predicted climate change scenarios are likely to significantly influence the evolution of stratification and thus impact larval survival over Georges Bank. As part of U.S GLOBEC Georges Bank Study, Dr. Beardsley and collaborators will conduct an intensive field project during January August, 1995 aimed at better understanding the development of stratification over Georges Bank and its influence of larval fish survival. Preliminary studies will be initiated in 1994. The project will have a moored instrument component will involve deploying meteorological sensors and instruments throughout the water column, with a heavy concentration in the surface and bottom boundary layers. The data acquired will be used to resolve the stratification field and examine factors controlling its development. The shipboard measurement component will consist of five cruises following a concentration (patch) of the target species: cod and haddock larvae and their copepod prey, Calanus and Pseudocalanus. Using a variety of sampling systems, including drifters, MOCNESS, the Video Plankton Recorder (VPR), plankton pump, and multiple high frequency acoustical samplers, measurements will be made of: (1) hydrography, micr oturbulence, and currents, (2) the vertical and horizontal distributions of the target species in relation to water column stratification, (3) passive particle motions and the three dimensional swimming behaviors of individual zooplankton, and (4) the feeding and growth of larval cod and haddock in relation to water column stratification and prey distribution. The data will be used together with information from collaborative field and modeling studies to gain insights into the impact of stratification and turbulent mixing on growth and survival of zooplankton and fish populations.\n",

It is being jointly funded by the Divisions of Ocean Sciences and Chemistry. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the speciation and trophic transfer of selenium in San Francisco Bay. Estuaries such as this, are complex physical, chemical and biological environments that are not only geochemically crucial (e.g. elemental transfer from the trash water to the marine environment), but are also economically vital (e.g. fisheries, transportation). The estuarine geochemistry of trace elements has been well studied, but the linkage between the chemical speciation of these trace elements and their cycling throughout the whole estuarine food web is largely unknown. The combination of innovative field and lab studies proposed here will allow researchers to more accurately predict the impact of Se input and speciation on the entire trophic structure of these environments. Moreover, the methods and approach used here for Se should be applicable to other trace elements and other estuarine environments. ** Cutter, OCE-9707946; Fisher OCE-9714308 $ + - - á +f/ªÛ=+- ±- ?- ¼f + + - À Ã ½ Ú ã ú u ) c Û + À À Ã ³ ½ Ú ¸ +$ ¸ +$ ¸ +$ ¸ +$ ¸ +$ P +$ P +$ P +$ ó +$?

      "Observations with recently developed microstructure instrumentation indicate that what had previously been described as small scale biological patchiness may not be due to stochastic fluctuations in biological structure, but may be undersampled observations of persistent, small scale structure. Persistent, sub 1-meter structure in the upper ocean poses serious problems for the interpretation of data from finescale and mesoscale observational programs. It is likely that such sampling programs are underestimating the in situ rate processes associated with sub 1-meter structure, as well as the abundance and distributional patterns of biological and chemical properties. The common occurrence of thin layers and the temporal/spatial coherence of these layers compel us to evaluate their role in upper ocean processes. Therefore, the overall objectives of this project are to evaluate the contribution of these sub-1-meter features to upper ocean trophic dynamics through direct measurements of nutrient concentration, particulate matter, autotrophic production, and heterotrophic processes, and to undertake a detailed study of the occurrence, persistence, and composition of thin biological layers in the ocean. In addition, our unique high resolution biological and physical sampling system will permit us to investigate the mechanisms of layer formation, persistence and erasure. We will determine the distribution and temporal coherence of thin layers of plankton biomass within the euphoric zone over extended time periods and characterize the composition of biological thin layers using bio optical and bio acoustical sensors as well as via discrete sampling of individual thin layers. We will also assess autotrophic and heterotrophic rate processes inside and outside of persistent small scale features and map the areal extent of coherent thin layers. We will also quantify the association of thin layers with local physical processes, specifically stratification, small scale shear, and turbulent mixing, as well as the large scale velocity field and the frequency and amplitude of internal waves. Finally, we will investigate the association of thin layers with local surface forcing conditions and evaluate the contribution of biological rates occurring within layers to total water column processes. This data set will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate, quantitatively, the role of persistent small scale structure in oceanic planktonic food webs. Without a clear evaluation of these processes, estimates of biological rates obtained with conventional sampling approaches will be biased. +n ±i ?n ¼f S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n ( ++++++++++++ 8 Û ++++++++++++ ++++++++++++ ++++++++++++ + _ Ûª?

Key elements of Eco-DÂS include:<br/><br/>1) Fostering sustained, cross-disciplinary interactions among the top new researchers in ecological oceanography and limnology.<br/>2) Increasing the success rate of new researchers seeking funding to build their research programs, by familiarizing them with the diversity of available research opportunities, and introducing them to representatives of funding agencies with whom they will interact in future.<br/>3) Increasing the likelihood of professional success for these new researchers by highlighting their initial work through high-visibility, open-access publication of a formal symposium proceedings volume; focusing that volume on interdisciplinary and collaborative aspects of their work; and establishing mentoring relationships between participants and established scientists.<br/>4) Enhancing U.S. science through preferential selection of participants who are current U.S. residents, or demonstrably have specific plans to conduct research in the U.S. or with U.S. scientists in the near future.<br/><br/>There will be three symposia at roughly 24 month intervals, the first - Eco-DÂS VIII to be held in October 2008. The following two will be held in fall 2010 and fall 2012. The Eco-DÂS symposium series will be held at the East-West Center immediately adjacent to the University of Hawai`i, Mânoa campus. The East-West Center conference facility is physically designed to facilitate workshops and conferences in which communication and interaction are particularly important. It is conveniently located near the internationally recognized School of Earth and Ocean Science and Technology (SOEST). Two other symposium series, the Dissertations Symposium on Chemical Oceanography (DISCO) and the Physical Oceanography Dissertation Symposium (PODS), have employed this venue with great success. The facility can easily accommodate symposium participants as well as mentors and observers, and provides for breakout rooms for focus groups.<br/><br/>The broader impacts are significant and far reaching. The symposium series will encourage and foster interdisciplinary collaborations among early career scientists from diverse subdisciplines, to the benefit of both the science and the researchers. The symposium series will also provide valuable feedback to funding agencies. The symposium participants represent the latest additions to the national research effort and are likely to become leading scientists in future. They will be challenged to identify needs and recommend directions for future research in ecological oceanography and limnology. Furthermore, a professional evaluation will assess whether the symposium series has achieved its objectives. Evaluation will include tracking of participants throughout the course of the proposed program (and ideally, over a longer period), and evaluating their professional success, their interactions with other participants, and the impact of the symposium series on the fields of ecological oceanography and limnology.\n",

Mesozooplankton grazing (consumption of phytoplankton and protozoa), sloppy feeding (DOM release), fecal pellet production and downward carbon transport due to diel vertical migrators (part of carbon export) are essential elements of this analysis. Although this proposal focuses on mesozooplankton, the our efforts will be collaborative with other JGOFS synthesis efforts.

Studies of electromagnetic and seismic wave propagation in the mantle with arrays of ocean- bottom instruments will furnish measurements that can be inverted to find horizontal and vertical variations in velocity and conductivity structure that can be used to test theoretical models of flow. An array of 47 ocean-bottom seismometers will be deployed for six months on the East Pacific Rise at about 17 degrees south to record teleseismic and regional earthquake sources. P and S waves, as well as other bady wave phases and Love and Rayleigh surface waves recorded by the array will be used to probe lateral variations in mantle to a depth of 100 to 200 km and out to several hundred km from the ridge axis.

The measurements would provide maps of the evolution of the spatial and temporal variability in the regional circulation and the interactions of local flow with eddies generated at the retroflection of the North Brazil Current. The radar would operate in HF mode which would provide a spatial resolution of 1 km and would coincide with the shipboard biological/physical sampling scheme. The radar currents would provide crucial information on the dominant flow components such as tides, wind-driven, mean and residual circulation in this region. The HF radar measurements would be used to characterize the time space scales of the hydrographic signatures associated with eddies generated by the retroflection of the North Brazil Current. The addition of the remotely sensed currents to the shipboard sampling will provide direct measurements of the surface flow. Such information is crucial to interpreting the distribution of late-stage larvae that occupy this upper layer of the water column. Decomposing the current into components would be used to examine how the flow is influenced by such forcing agents as the wind. This is particularly valuable in the lee of the island where the wind stress will vary both spatially and temporally. Combining the surface and subsurface current measurements with the biological sampling would allow us to examine the linkages between reef fish larval distributions and island flow patterns. Specifically our study could assess the impact of offshore mesoscale events disturbing the local now regime and the fate of larval retention. Such knowledge is essential to understand the translocation patterns of coral reef fish larvae in an island wake environment.\n",

The PI will perform a Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) with a free- surface for flows in four scenarios: 1) a single polynomial hill, 2) two- dimensional sinusoidal topography, 3) three-dimensional sinusoidal topography, and 4) a channel and shoal configuration. The numerical output will be analyzed to investigate patterns of stress and advection on the surface which may be used to identify underlying topography.\n",

The JPO/GCOS will base this coordination on its comprehensive approach to identifying (a) the scientific requirements for observations of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and cryosphere, using both in situ and space-based observing systems, and (b) the needs for and development of plans for a comprehensive data management system in support of the three observing systems. The JPO/GCOS will develop protocols to integrate data obtained from both networks; identify ecological sites for joint observations; identify river observing sites as an initial hydrological cycle observing system; develop demonstration/ pilot projects (possibly on soil carbon) to test the ability of the observing systems to make observations and deliver collected data rapidly and effectively; and promote further development of an integrated data management system for terrestrial observations.\n",

      "*** 9618135 Epstein This project addresses trophic relations between sediment micrograzers and bacteria of particular biogeochemical importance. It is suggested that proto- and micrometazoan grazers balance production of sediment chemo- and photolithotrophs and thus become important players in the dynamics of reduced and oxidized forms of sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon, and possibly Mn and Fe. This idea is supported by the results of previously work, pilot data, and literature information. All these data suggest the following ideas. 1. Major sediment microbacterivores (flagellates, ciliates, nematodes, and others) are concentrated in a specific sediment layer, at and immediately below oxic/anoxic interface. 2. It is exactly in this sediment layer that most sulfide, ammonium, and methane oxidizing chemolithotrophs, as well as anaerobic photosynthesizers, are known to concentrate. 3. In this particular layer, which exhibits increased grazing pressure over bacteria, micrograzers appear to remove daily up to 50% of bacterial standing stock. Based on the above evidence, the following hypothesis is advanced. Proto- and micrometazoan grazing controls bacterial dynamics in a specific sediment layer at and immediately below the oxic/anoxic interface. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the rates of bacterivory by sediment flagellates, ciliates, nematodes, and other micrograzers, with bacterial standing stock and bacterial production in the identified sediment layer. This will be done by a combination of classical, modern, and novel approaches. Seasonality will be examined by conducting the experiments in two different seasons, which were previously shown to contrast with each other in the microbial food web structure. At each seasonal time point, experiments will account for daily dynamics in grazing activity and vertical migrations of prospective bacterivores. Many key techniques to b e used here have been substantially improved, and supporting evidence collected, under prior NSF support. The model community (fine intertidal sands, Boston Harbor) has been under study for several years and is uniquely suited for the planned research. This work is one of the first to introduce spatial motives into studies of sediment microbial food webs. The target of this research are those functional types of bacteria that are particularly important in sediment biogeochemistry, nutrient recycling, and sediment-water exchange. The significance of studying mechanisms governing these bacteria dynamics goes therefore beyond its intrinsic value for detailing benthic microbial food web structure, and is important in a much larger ecological context.\n",

      "*** 9618722 Marra The last series of WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) cruises will begin the North Atlantic in summer, 1997. For JGOFS, the collaboration with the WHP has been for a CO2 survey, and for bio-optics and pigments, in order to obtain a spatially extensive data set on upper ocean properties. For the WHP section A20 (roughly along 55 W from the Grand Banks to Trinidad), data on bio-optical (spectral irradiance, fluorescence, beam attenuation, chlorophyll-a) and physical (temperature, salinity) properties in near- surface waters will be collected at a station spacing of no more than 100 km. The objective of this observational program is to determine whether the biogeochemical provinces that have been described for the western North Atlantic have a big-optical basis. The descriptions of the provinces rely on currents, water-column stability, temperature, proximity to land, etc., but are only semi-quantitative. The hypothesis to be tested is whether these provinces exist in a big-optical sense, the null hypothesis being that there are no big-optical differences along the transect beyond the distinction of Case- 1 and Case-2 waters. Since the cruise will occur in summer, with surface temperature differences at a minimum, the data collected will be a stronger test of the alternative hypothesis (that bio- optical provinces exist) than otherwise. Once collated and organized, the data will be made available to all investigators via the World-Wide Web. If biogeochemical provinces can be shown to exist as big-optical entities, it will allow greater precision in the calculation of primary production from satellite imagery, and also prove useful in helping to classify ocean areas with respect to their plankton ecology. Biogeochemical provinces are thus a means or organizing the study of the mechanistic basis of plankton processes. It is expected that the WHP cruises will occur after the launch (now scheduled for February, 1997) of the new ocean color sensor, SeaW iFS, and thus this observational program may assist in providing sea-truth for the satellite data.\n",

      "Physiological ecology of intertidal development: <br/>linking embryo performance and adult reproductive ecology<br/><br/>Among marine habitats, intertidal areas are extreme in their variability: tides create a suite of <br/>physical changes that alter not only the mean and variance of environmental conditions, but also the frequency of exposure to stress. For species that develop in these habitats, survival and growth depend on biochemical defenses mounted by embryos or on the selective timing or location of reproduction by adults. Fitness consequences of spawning vary in time and space, but adults have imperfect information about future conditions that embryos will face. While adult responses are well-characterized, we know relatively little about consequences of variability or stress for early stages, which are especially sensitive to physical conditions and often represent a life-history bottleneck. This project is an integrative research program in the physiological ecology of intertidal reproduction and development. Egg masses of the mollusc Melanochlamys diomedea are tethered in tide pools on the surface of sand flats, where they experience developmental conditions that are highly variable within and between tidal exchanges. This species provides a sensitive and tractable system to relate embryo physiology, growth and survival, in both the lab and field, to conditions of environmental variability and stress. In addition, the ability to track adult reproductive output relative to environmental conditions allows tests of whether reproductive patterns are plastic and adaptive. Specifically, (1) To resolve developmental and ecological conditions for embryonic stress protein expression. Temperature thresholds and the developmental onset of stress protein induction in embryos collected in different seasons and from thermally distinct habitats will be determined. (2) To measure effects of temperature variability and stress on developmental performance. Embryos will be exposed to controlled temperature profiles to distinguish the contributions to performance of temperature mean, variance, stress level, and rate of change. (3) To estimate the developmental consequences of temperature variability under field conditions. Short-term exposure of egg masses to field conditions and manipulation of UV will be used to model the developmental consequences of natural variation in temperature and UV. (4) To evaluate the contribution of adult reproductive timing to developmental success. Adult reproductive patterns in the field will be used to test the hypotheses that the timing of reproduction is non-random, correlated with environmental conditions, and beneficial to offspring. Intertidal habitats offer a unique arena for understanding the impact of ecological conditions on marine development and life-history evolution. Because early stages are sensitive to physical conditions, and often represent a bottleneck in marine population dynamics, populations that reproduce in intertidal areas may be especially vulnerable to environmental challenges. This project develops a unique approach to understanding the intersection of environmental variability, developmental physiology, and reproductive ecology in a highly relevant marine environment. It integrates information on mechanisms of stress protection, developmental performance, field conditions, and reproductive timing to understand responses to variability and stress at two distinct but functionally-linked phases of the life cycle. By modeling development as a function of variation in natural conditions, it makes and tests explicit predictions about the fitness consequences of adult reproductive decisions. Because temperature stability is the dominant paradigm in marine development, research on responses to natural variability will further our understanding of both basic developmental biology and the physiological ecology of marine early life histories. The proposed research and educational goals create opportunities for students at several stages of education to participate in integrative research. Involvement with the FHL Blinks Mentorship program will allow regular participation of minority students in the PI's lab and in the department honors research program.
